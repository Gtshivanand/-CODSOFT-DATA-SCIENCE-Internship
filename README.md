# CODSOFT_DATA_SCIENCE_Internship

Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at CODSOFT. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. 

# Description:
A showcase of my work as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. This repository reflects my journey in applying data science techniques to solve business challenges and extract actionable insights from data.

# Contents Include:

* In-depth analysis of datasets with Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn.

* Machine learning models built using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and more.

* Projects tackling problems like customer segmentation, sentiment analysis, and price prediction.

* Well-structured notebooks and code for easy understanding and reproducibility.

# The key accomplishments include:

* Predictive Modeling: Built machine learning models achieving over 90% accuracy in classification and regression tasks.

* Data Analysis: Analyzed datasets with over 100K records, extracting actionable insights for decision-making.

* Data Visualization: Developed intuitive visualizations to present complex data stories, making them accessible to non-technical audiences.

# Key Highlights:

* Application of machine learning techniques to solve classification and regression problems.

* Clustering methods for data segmentation and pattern recognition.

* Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib,and Jupyter Notebook.

* Emphasis on reproducibility and clear documentation for each project.


  ### DATA SCIENCE TASKS:

 **TASK 1**: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

  - SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/
  - TASK: Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
